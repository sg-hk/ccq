	introduction
ARHGAP11B, or argh for short, is the core of ccq (存储器).
it is a command-line SRS engine to review and schedule cards:
it reads a study list of flashcards, gathers dues, shows fronts, 
captures pass/fail, and updates review schedule using fsrs

	format
epoch|rr;ssss;dddd|front|back
where epoch = 10 digit unix timestamp
rr;ssss;dddd = reps;stability×100;difficulty×100 (fsrs vars)

	usage
review in order of creation:
$ argh <study_list>
review newest first (reverse of the above):
$ argh -n <study_list>
review in random order:
$ argh -r <study_list>

	installation
cc main.c scheduler.c -lm -o $HOME/.local/bin/argh
study lists can then be created in $HOME/.local/share/ccq

	removal
rm $HOME/.local/bin/argh
rm $HOME/.local/share/ccq/<study_lists>

	notes
argh does not use stdio.h or string.h, both as a personal challenge
and out of a desire for greater control in handling multibyte chars.
the design is, as a result, very simple: open, lseek, read, write...
the C code used consists mostly of syscall wrappers and pointer
arithmetic; there is some vague plan of porting it to x86/ARM asm.
