.TH CCQ 5 "May 22, 2025" "ccq Manual" "File Formats"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBccq\fR system primarily uses two types of plain text files: study lists and dictionary databases. All text is processed as single-byte character sequences. Fields are typically separated by a pipe symbol (\fB|\fR), and records (lines) are separated by a newline character (\fB\eN\fR).

.SS STUDY LIST FORMAT
Each line in a study list file represents a single flashcard and its scheduling parameters. The format is:
.PP
\fIepoch\fR\fB|\fR\fIfsrs_data\fR\fB|\fR\fIkey\fR\fB|\fR\fIback\fR\fB\eN\fR
.TP
.B \fIepoch\fR
A 10-digit ASCII string representing the UNIX timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC) when this card is next due for review.
.TP
.B \fIfsrs_data\fR
A 12-character ASCII string storing FSRS parameters. The format is "RR;SSSS;DDDD", where:
.RS
.TP
.B RR
Two digits representing the number of repetitions (00-99).
.TP
.B SSSS
Four digits representing the card's stability value multiplied by 100 (e.g., "0250" for stability 2.50).
.TP
.B DDDD
Four digits representing the card's difficulty value multiplied by 100 (e.g., "0500" for difficulty 5.00).
.RE
Example: \fB00;0250;0500\fR for a new card with 0 repetitions, stability 2.50, and difficulty 5.00.
.TP
.B \fIkey\fR
Variable-length string representing the "front" or prompt of the flashcard. It should not contain newline characters.
.TP
.B \fIback\fR
Variable-length string representing the "back" or answer of the flashcard. It should not contain newline characters.

.SS DICTIONARY DATABASE FORMAT
Each line in a dictionary database file represents a potential entry that can be queried and added to a study list. The file should be sorted by the \fIkey\fR field to allow for efficient binary searching. The format is:
.PP
\fIkey\fR\fB|\fR\fIdictionary_name\fR\fB|\fR\fIback\fR\fB\eN\fR
.TP
.B \fIkey\fR
Variable-length string representing the term or phrase to be looked up.
.TP
.B \fIdictionary_name\fR
Variable-length string identifying the source dictionary or category of the entry (e.g., "JMDict", "WordNet").
.TP
.B \fIback\fR
Variable-length string providing the definition, translation, or other information related to the \fIkey\fR.

.SH NOTES
All files are expected to use single-byte character encodings compatible with the system's locale settings if non-ASCII characters are present (though \fBccq\fR primarily processes bytes). The parsing is strict about delimiters and expects fields to be present.
