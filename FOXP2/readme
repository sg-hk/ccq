	introduction
foxp2, or fox for short, is the study‑list editor for ccq (存储器).
it reads the database, lets you add/change/delete cards by key,
and writes updates back into your study list file.

	format
key|dictionary name|entry  
that is the database format. the study list details can be found
in argh's readme: epoch|rr;ssss;dddd|front|back  

	usage
look up <key> in database, and add the definition to the study list
  $ fox -a <study_list> <key>
change <key>'s back: 
  $ fox -c <study_list> <key> 
delete <key> from the study list:
  $ fox -d <study_list> <key>  

since the study list is a simple psv (pipe-separated values), 
you can of course simply edit the file directly with your favorite text editor. 
for manual card creation in nvim, you may find this shortcut useful;
it fills the two first fields (epoch and fsrs init values) for you:
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>f', function()
    local text = os.time() .. '|00;0250;0500|'
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(text, 'n', false) 
    vim.cmd('startinsert') 
  end, { noremap = true, silent = true })

	installation
  cc main.c -o $HOME/.local/bin/fox
  mv db $HOME/.local/share/ccq/
ensure your database and study lists live under:  
  $HOME/.local/share/ccq/

	removal
  rm $HOME/.local/bin/fox  
  rm $HOME/.local/share/ccq/db

	notes
just like argh, fox avoids using stdio.h and string.h
text is treated as raw binary and parsed with read() and lseek()
